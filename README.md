#### Files in this (gettingcleaningdata-coursera) repo
1. CodeBook.md: describes the variables, data, and work done to clean up the data from the downloaded dataset <br/> <br/>
2. run_analysis.R: performs functions on the data from the downloaded dataset as required by the project including: <br/>
  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set <br/>
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement <br/>
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set <br/>
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names <br/>
  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject <br/> <br/>
3. finalData.txt: the final data after being tidied by the process described above
